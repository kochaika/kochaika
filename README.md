# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

ðŸŽ“ Iâ€™m Educational Content Manager at [JetBrains Academy](https://academy.jetbrains.com/) and also a teacher at the [Constructor University](https://constructor.university/programs/undergraduate-education/software-data-and-technology).   
Essentially, I'm working on making education better, online courses high-quality, and the tasks in them more interesting and unique. 

ðŸ”­ I have more than 7 years of experience in Education & Research. During that time, I worked:
- Researcher at Mobile Robot Algorithms Lab in JetBrains Research
- Researcher & Teacher at Intelligent mobile systems laboratory in Saint-Petersburg Electrotechnical University
- Teacher at Saint Petersburg State University
- Teacher at Supplementary Education Center at Saint Petersburg's School #777 

ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡² Now I'm living in Armenia 

âš¡ Fun fact: I used to have for many years a `pro100kot` nickname on GitHub, but I decided it looked too informal
