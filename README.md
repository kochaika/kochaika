# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

ðŸŽ“ Iâ€™m Educational Content Manager at [JetBrains Academy](https://academy.jetbrains.com/) and also a teacher at the university.   
Essentially, I'm working on making education better, online courses high-quality, and the tasks in them more interesting and unique. 

ðŸ”­ I have more than 6 years of experience in Education & Research. During that time, I worked:
- JBR Researcher
- ETU Researcher + teacher
- SPBU Teacher
- School 777 Teacher

ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡² Now I'm living in Armenia 

âš¡ Fun fact: I used to have for years a `pro100kot` nickname on GitHub, but I decided it looked too informal
